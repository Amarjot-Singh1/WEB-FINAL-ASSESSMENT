            CARROM BOARD
        </h1>
        <div>
        <P>
            Carrom, also known as carrom board or carroms, is a popular table-top game that originated in India. It is played by two or four players who sit around a square wooden board with pockets in each corner. The objective of the game is to use a striker and small circular pieces called carrom men to pocket all of your pieces before your opponent does the same.
            The carrom board is typically made of plywood and measures about 74 cm square. The playing surface is smooth and coated with a fine powder, often made from boric acid or French chalk, to reduce friction and allow the carrom men to glide easily across the board. The corners of the board are fitted with netted pockets to catch the carrom men as they are pocketed.
            Each player has a set of carrom men, usually consisting of nine black and nine white pieces, as well as a striker, which is a larger piece that is used to hit the carrom men. To start the game, the carrom men are arranged in a specific formation in the center of the board, and the players take turns striking their own pieces with the striker in an attempt to pocket them into one of the corner pockets.
            Carrom is a game that requires both skill and strategy. Players must carefully aim their shots and use the right amount of force to hit the carrom men into the pockets. They must also be mindful of their opponent's moves and try to block them from pocketing their own pieces. With its simple rules and fast-paced gameplay, carrom is a beloved pastime in many parts of the world and is enjoyed by people of all ages and skill levels.

            OBJECTIVE OF GAME
        </h1>
        <div>
        <P>
            The objective of the carrom board game is to use a striker and small circular pieces called carrom men to pocket all of your pieces before your opponent does the same. The player who manages to pocket all of their pieces first and the queen earns the maximum points and wins the game. The game requires a combination of skill, strategy, and accuracy in aiming and hitting the carrom men into the pockets.
            Players can earn points by pocketing their own pieces or the queen, which is a larger piece with a red dot on it. The queen is worth three points, while other pieces are worth one or two points depending on their color. The first player to reach a certain number of points, typically 21 or 25, wins the game.
