    <h1>The Rules of Carrom</h1>
    <div>
    <p>The Carrom game is played on a square board with pockets in each corner. The game involves flicking small wooden discs called carrom men into the pockets using a striker. Singles or doubles can play the game. The primary objective is to use the striker to hit the carrom men into the pockets while also preventing the opponent from doing the same. The player or team that scores the most points by pocketing their carrom men and the queen (a special disc with a red dot) wins the game. It is essential to follow the rules of Carrom while playing, including the use of fouls, penalties, and the order of play. These rules may differ slightly based on the region or competition.</p>
